          <h4>Greetings!</h4><br>
          <p>Well, this is me: A GIS Analyst, ex-archaeologist, and IT developer.<br>
            From two years on, I devoted myself to web development projects, getting acquainted with front-end (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Handlebars) and some back-end (Maven, Node.js, PHP, SQL) technologies, which provided me with a general view of the field and a "junior" working capacity. However, no proper job position achieved so far.
            Nevertheless, this last year I have expanded my IT skills to the GeoWeb ecosystem by enroling on a MSc in GIS Technologies. This provided me with an excellent update on my traditional GIS skills, and, more importantly, on a new array of tech and skills directly connected to web development and data analysis. 
            Thus, I am competent in using open data (geospatial data, actually), APIs (Google Maps, MapboxGL), and web mapping libraries (leaflet.js) to provide geospatial capabilities and data to web and mobile apps.

          <p>Before that I have been on the Archaeologist track for about twenty years. My interest on IT tech was already there since Archaeological research moves right behind 
            cutting-edge scientific research tech and methods. Then, I learned about something called GIS and spatial analysis applied to Archaeology, which entailed amazing research possibilities.
            From there I got involved in data management, databases, SQL sentences, and thematic cartography. In short: a mixed profile composed by humanistic perspective 
            and technological skills focused in spatial-related solutions for research questions. Thanks to that I have worked in a number of spatial-related projects, 
            both in the academic world, and in engineering and building companies. In sum, I can proudly say that I had a rich and productive career, crowned by a PhD in 
            Archaeology.

            But times change, my path was stalling, and I decided to go with the times and swapped careers. I brainstormed for a littel while and realize that tech had been a constant
            since the beginng. Moreover, and as happens today, tech was already everywhere. The choice seemed rather obvious for me, and now, here I am! 
            <br>
